    <p> The hobby that (alarmingly) takes up most of my time is gaming. <br>
      I mostly play on my XBox One or PS4, but occasionally use my laptop as well. <br>
      When I'm not playing video games, I like watch TV and movies.  I have a particular interest in science fiction works. <br>

    <p> On days when I don't feel like staring at a screen for extended periods of time, I like to bring an old set of LEGOs out of the closet. <br>
      I have been tinkering with LEGOs ever since I got my first set.  I don't really plan on building anything, I mainly start sticking bricks togther and see what happens. <br>

    <p> Back in California, I started taking karate lessons just befor starting middle school. <br>
      I needed some athletic actvity and the previous few years of Little League sports didn't work our so well. <br>
      The karate lessons worked out much better and I stuck with it untill i left California.
