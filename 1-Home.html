    <p> My name is Christopher Ryan Louie.  I was born on May 4, 1993 in Daly City, California. </p>
    <p> I lived in California for most of my life, until I moved to Arizona in 2012 to attend Arizona State University. <br>
      I attended ASU for five years and graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering. <br>
      Now I am going through Coder Camp's Full Stack Web Development program, which will last three months. <br>
      After attending this new school and program, I should be employed before the end of 2018.
