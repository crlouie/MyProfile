    <h2> My Family </h2>

    <p> I have a very uninteresting family tree.  As far as I know, the generations before me have all been Chinese. <br>
      My dad was born in Hong Kong, before moving and growing up in the United States.<br>
      My mom grew up in Burma, but she's still genetically Chinese. She moved to the United States as an adult with the rest of her family. <br>
      I was born and raised here in the United States.  I grew up living about an hour away from San Francisco.  <br>
      I am only child.
